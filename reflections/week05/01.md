## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

   - Query strings allow us to pass information to and from a website.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

   - Query parameters start with a ? and inputed with a key / value pair. Ex( ?answer=32 ) . If more than one parameter is needed we can utilize the '&' to add to our query.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
   - I believe Query parameters will allow us to set other flags in our system to provide x data back based on the query. An example would be grabbing information from a database but rather than supply the huge payload, the user can provide a query on what size they would like to receive the payload in.
