# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.


Week 5 flew by quick and there was definitely a lot of great tech to learn. I'll definitely need some more time understanding database relations, and virtuals but I will hopefully get it here soon. Looking forward to Vuew. 

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
