# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  - Started to get a better understanding of designing with bootstrap and flexbox.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  - Tons ! The team has great knowledge and experience to help speed up coding and severals ways to address a solution. I honestly feel like I have a better grasp when developing a website.
- What are you struggling with?
  - Nothing at the moment. I'll probably have to circle back to flex box references every now and then but i'm close.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - Developing a better understanding of flexbox and web layouts.
