## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

   - Psuedo-class allow additional customization to an element. Most common one would probably be hover (Ex : highlights for buttons), checked (targets radio / checkboxes for when they are checked or toggled ), enable/disable (Selects the state of an input when its enabled / disabled)

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
   - CSS utilizes specificity to determine style hierarchy. We can use specificity to target certain elements or use to see what elements are higher specificity
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
   - This could potentially cause a bottleneck as the code now requires users to look at each element selector to see which one has the !important tag in order to apply their own style accordingly.
