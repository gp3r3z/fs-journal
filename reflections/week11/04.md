## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I can't believe its Week 11 and its almost the end of January. Time is flying but definitely excited to see how far i've come in my coding. Very excited to keep chipping at my craft and explore other future technologies.
