## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
   - Primary keys are pieces of data which are typically unique whereas foreign keys are used to reference data on another table.
2. What is an `Alias`?

- Alias are abbreviations or small keyword instances to be used in place of writting out the full name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

SELECT \* FROM doctorsP dr
INNER JOIN patients p ON p.id = dr.patientId
INNER JOIN doctors doc ON doc.id = dr.doctorsId

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsP (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
