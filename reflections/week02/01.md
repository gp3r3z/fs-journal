## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

- Scope defines the variables available to use in the scope of the block. These can be set either global or local.

2. What is Hoisting ?

- Declared variables and functions are moved to the top of scope before code execution

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
   - You might use var in a few instances where you need to declare a global variable for data manipulation but let would be the better choice. LET provides a scope local to the block and can be updated. Meanwhile if we didn't want the data to be manipulated we could then use a const / static variable.
