# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

- Phew, second week in and I feel a lot better with the flow of things. The topics were fun and challenging. I also feel confident in buidling out quick websites. I can't wait to see what in store for javascript.
