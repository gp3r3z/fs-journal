## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

   - Functions can be called by Declaration, expression and for shorter syntax by an arrow function expression. Declaration functions are hoisted, which allows a function to be used before defined. Function expression are name or anonymous functions and are not hoisted like declaration. Finally an arrow expression is a shorter syntax for writing function expressions but arrow functions do not create their own "this" value.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

   - The differences between parameters and arguments are, parameters are defined at the function for the values to be supplied meanwhile arguments are the values inputted at function call / executed.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
   - High order functions accept another function as a parameter. A good example is using .filter on Array.prototype.filter to filter through the data.
