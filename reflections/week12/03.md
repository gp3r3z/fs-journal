# Daily Reflection

Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.

## Prompts

- How is today going?
- Are you managing your stress?

Day 3 ! Whooo today was a lot of highs and lows. I endedup having to rework my BE as my data wasn't exactly what I needed and even though they passed the postman test the data presented wasn't accurate. I discovered this when my FE didn't have the correct data but this definitely threw me for a loop. On the brightside my BE logic now makes more sense then previously.
