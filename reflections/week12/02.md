# Daily Reflection

Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?

## Prompts

- How is today going?
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

Finished my BE ! Felt great as that was the biggest hurrdle for me to climb. I definitely starting to like csharp more but i'll need more time to fully grasp the tech. Next up is FE !
