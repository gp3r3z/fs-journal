## Questions

1. What are props?

   - Props are how we are able to pass down data from different component.

2. What are props used for?

   - Props are used to pass data down the component tree and accessed (read-only).

3. Where can props be used or accessed?
   To use props properly you'll need to use v-bind on the parent component then on the child component set a 'listener' by adding a props section. The template is then able to
   access the data.
