## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
     + The 3 categores of data types are : 
        1) Value Types: Holds data value within its own memory space (menaing it directly contains a value)
        2) Reference Type: contain a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. 
        3) Pointer Type: Holds memory address of another type. 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
    + To name a few of the value types that stick out are bool, char, enum, int, long and double. Javascript has similar data types which is great in terms of understanding how each data type can be used or manipulated


3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
     + From my understanding refernce types reference a value stored elsewhere and doesn't store the data. Meaning a subsitute alias is used in place (ex data addresss).
