## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide? + Unit testing + Component TEsting + End to end testing

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
   I believe end to end would be the most useful as this provides the most comprehensive insight.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
   - I think component testing would be the least useful compared to unit and e2e testing because with vue you would only be testing mounted components to the DOM. On the other hand (if i'm following) the other 2 test provide additional insight to the application / system.
