## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
   1. + The purpose of encapsulation is to provide access to certain areas of an application. In other words users don't directly have access to the manipulate data unless the developer provide the source. 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
    + This can be problematic for several reasons. An example for using the underscore prefix first,  underscore isn't a set standard but commonly known by experienced developers so there tends to be wires crossed when involving new developers. In regards to using closures, multiple uses can slow down your application due to duplication of code in the memory 
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
    + To create a private variable you would need to create a const variable to use  a new class specified. This way the user only has access to read only the data presented.
