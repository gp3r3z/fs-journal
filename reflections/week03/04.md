> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
    + The observer pattern allows one to many data bindings between elements to avoid too many push and pull in the code.
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
    + The mechnaisms of the observer pattern are: 
        + Subscribe to add new observable events
        + unsubscribe: remove observable events
        + Broadcast: executes all events with boun data

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
     + Utilizing the template from bcw has built in proxy objects to subscribe to events which get and set the data supplied in our appstate. Pretty cool !
