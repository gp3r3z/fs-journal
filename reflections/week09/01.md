## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
    In our project we are utilizing the CRUD methods to help manipulate our database along with a node BE to received specified request. 

2. What went well so far?
    We had a great init start of the project. I believe this was very helpful to get our foundation and everyone on the same page. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?
    Research additional APIs for our main external. Main reason is because soon as we started we had issues with the API as it required additonal work needed (proxy server) to send request. We ended up pivoted to another API.
